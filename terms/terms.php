<h1>Terms &amp; conditions for *Company Name* residential services</h1>
</p>
We've made a promise to be a straight talking provider and avoid annoying legal jargon.
</p>
We appreciate that these legal bits are boring, and that you want to be using our great services as soon as possible,
so we've provided a handy summary of our terms.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<h2>The Full Monty</h2>
</p>
Our Full terms and conditions are set out below, and are made up of different sections.
</p>
The Standard Terms apply to everyone and then each service has it's own set of Service Terms, so you can just look at
the ones that are relevant to you.
</p>
If you are taking more than one service, the Package Terms may also apply.  If you're taking one of our great offers, some
extra Offer Terms will apply (as our offers change we'll tell you about these separately).
